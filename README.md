# Incident Prediction System

This project aims to predict the next incident for individuals based on historical data. The system uses a machine learning model to forecast when an incident is likely to occur, providing an important tool for monitoring and managing potentially risky individuals.

## Project Overview

The system uses data on abusers and incidents to predict the next incident's occurrence. It trains a Random Forest model on features such as incident frequency, severity, and other relevant factors. The goal is to predict the number of days until the next incident for each abuser, as well as to provide the estimated next incident date.

## Features

- **Incident Prediction**: Predicts the next incident date for each abuser.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Merges abuser information with frequency metrics and performs data cleaning and encoding.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Trains a Random Forest model to predict the days until the next incident.
- **Prediction Output**: Provides a CSV file with predictions for each abuser, including their next incident date and the days until it occurs.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/incident-prediction.git
    ```
2. Install required Python libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- datetime

## Usage

1. Prepare your data in CSV format:
   - `incident_data.csv`: Historical incident data for each abuser, including `Abuser_ID`, `Incident_Date`, `DOB_of_Abuser`, `Type_of_Incident`, etc.
   - `frequency_analysis.csv`: Frequency metrics for each abuser, including `Abuser_ID`, `incident_count`, `avg_days_between_incidents`, etc.
   
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python incident-prediction.py
